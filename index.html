                    <h3>Honda Fit</h3>
                    <p>The Good:

                            It's capacious, fuel economy is outstanding and it's pretty fun to drive. </p>
                            
                            <p>The Bad:
                            The engine could sound better, and the infotainment system could use an upgrade.</p>
                            
                            <p>The Bottom Line:
                            If your new car needs to be cheap and effective, good luck topping the Fit</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Honda Jazz</h3>
                    <p>The Good:
                        Big audio and air-con controls. Acres of space for bodies. Magic Seats equates to van-like load-lugging ability.</p>

                            <p>The Bad: 
                            Not quite as cute as before. Interior is very black and grey. iPod connectivity available overseas, but not here.</p>
                            
                            <p>The Bottom Line: 
                            The Jazz impresses with its abundance of space, cheery outlook on life and clever engineering.</p>

                    <h3>Honda Civic</h3>
                    <p>The Good:     
                            The Civic Type R has the cargo space and on-road comfort to function very well as a daily, but it's still boatloads of fun.</p>
                            
                            <p> The Bad:
                            It looks like teenagers designed it, and the infotainment system has aged like a wine with a bad cork.</p>
                            
                            <p> The Bottom Line:
                            If you can handle the looks, the Civic Type R will always leave you smiling, no matter the destination.</p>
